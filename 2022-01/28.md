## 28/01/22

Well, this is the first day, everything has a beginning, right?

After many years working with IT, there will come a time when you will feel frustrated and VERY willing to abandon everything and walk away.

this day came to me today.


Ritalin for work, rivotril to chill that is the secret for success ?
Success for who ?

my desire today is to leave my position as a cloud developer, but I can't;

Stress and anxiety are part of my everyday life. Chest pain, shortness of breath don't scare me anymore. Is it common to feel this several times a day?

Is a job really worth all that?

There are many questions and the answer seems simple, but right now I can't answer.

maybe i better take another dose of rivotril.
